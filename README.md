# ImageModifier

## My first project using Java in which I took help of predefined packages and classes to work on images

### Convolver.java

Convolver creates a one dimensional array out of the loaded image. Convolver also provides a matrix of image so that it is easy to work on features like applying mirror effects.

### LoadedImage.java

LoadedImage is a subclass of Canvas that is used to set and reset the image display.

### Packages and classes used
1. java.awt
2. java.awt.image
3. java.awt.event
4. java.io
5. javax.imageio
6. java.lang.reflect
